I am a software engineer at [Materialize](https://materialize.com). I used to
work at [Ververica](https://ververica.com), which we founded in 2014 to work on
[Apache FlinkÂ®](https://flink.apache.org).

These posts are my own thoughts on software development (and other things).

There is also a (probably incomplete) list of my past
[talks/publications](publications.md).

Yes, this is a Github repository, you can follow it to receive updates or open
pull requests if you want to fix something.
