I am a software engineer/engineering lead at
[Ververica](https://ververica.com), which we founded in 2014 to work on [Apache
FlinkÂ®](https://flink.apache.org). I am also a member of the Apache Flink
[PMC](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html), which means that I can commit code
and am responsible (with others) for managing the open-source project.

These posts are my own thoughts on Flink development (and other things). Some
of them reflect community discussions or will (should?) turn into
[FLIPs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Flink+Improvement+Proposals)
(Flink Improvement Proposals). The posts are in reverse chronological order.

Yes, this is a Github repository, you can follow it to receive updates or open
pull requests if you want to fix something.
